This feature on in our applications allows users to have a personalized experience. When a user makes an account, they have the ability to search for recipes on our landing page and store them to their personal profiles so they always know where they are. If someone is not logged in or does not had a profile, they will be able to search recipes but not store them. They will see a tag on the recipe that says "Sign up to save"<br>
